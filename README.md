About:
In this project, I explored Bootstrap 5 to create a responsive and clean webpage, leveraging its built-in CSS for form validation and floating labels. Bootstrap 5 allows me to save time by providing a pleasant and modern design out of the box. While it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution for all CSS needs, it serves as an excellent starting point for developers. This frees me up to focus on refining the finer details within the web page.

I’ve updated my services’ ‘Contact Us’ form, allowing for a cleaner and more modern user interaction. The form now includes Bootstrap 5’s field validation, so users will know if they’ve missed any required information. When a user leaves a field blank, it will highlight in red with a short message guiding them in the right direction. Once the user fills out the field correctly, it will turn green, indicating that the validation requirements have been met.

Overall, Bootstrap 5 has been a valuable tool in streamlining my web development process!
